Retrieval of WCR functionalities: aggregation calculations to support the “Email Reports” (Reporting) and “KPI” functions (VISION portal dashboards) — pooling and allocation of responsibilities.

1) Migration of WCR functionalities

The migration of WCR functionalities is part of the overall modernization of the Information System for Decision Support (SID) and will enable the use of transactional data originating from ESTREEM, made available through the data platform.

Aggregation calculations for KPIs and production of email reports (EDD):
There are 5 critical email reports (EDD) required for 2026.
Approximately fifty EDDs exist overall (each EDD carries KPIs).

50% of remaining analytics dashboard functionalities still to be migrated to the VISION portal.

Integration of an Electronic Document Management (EDM/GED) tool to ensure the storage of email reports and their consultation via the VISION portal.

2) Rationalization of reference data and centralization within the data platform
